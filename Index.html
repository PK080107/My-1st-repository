<h1>Good for you by Olivia Rodrigo </h1>
<div>
<p>Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily
    <br>You found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
    <br>Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world? (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
    <br><strong>And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself</strong>
    <br>I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
    <br>Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl
    <br>Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy, not me
    <br>If you ever cared to ask
    <br>Good for you, you're doin' great out there without me, baby
    <br>God, I wish that I could do that
    <br>I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
    <br>Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
    <br>But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
    <br>But I guess good for you
    <br>Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (ah)
    <br>You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (ah)
    <br>It's like we never even happened
    <br>Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ha)
    <br>And good for you, it's like you never even met me
    <br>Remember when you swore to God I was the only
    <br>Person who ever got you?
    <br>Well, screw that and screw you
    <br>You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do
    <br>Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy, not me
    <br>If you ever cared to ask
    <br>Good for you, you're doin' great out there without me, baby
    <br>God, I wish that I could do that
    <br>I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
    <br>Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
    <br>But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
    <br>But I guess good for you
    <br>Ah-ah-ah-ah
    <br>Ah-ah-ah-ah
    <br>Maybe I'm too emotional
    <br>But your apathy's like a wound in salt
    <br>Maybe I'm too emotional
    <br>Or maybe you never cared at all
    <br>Maybe I'm too emotional
    <br>Your apathy is like a wound in salt
    <br>Maybe I'm too emotional
    <br>Or maybe you never cared at all
    <br>Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy, not me
    <br>If you ever cared to ask
    <br>Good for you, you're doin' great out there without me, baby
    <br><strong>Like a damn sociopath</strong>
    <br>I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
    <br>Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
    <br>But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
    <br>But I guess good for you
    <br>Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily</p>
